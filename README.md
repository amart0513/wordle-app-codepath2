# Wordle Pt. 2 Starter

This is the starter project for iOS 101 Project 2 - Wordle Pt. 2

Submitted by: **Angie Martinez**

**Wordle Pt. 2** is an app that allows the user to enter the word of the day. The user has 6 tries until 
they run out of spaces to fill in. However, if the user manages to get the word correct before all 6 spots
fill up, they completed the task in x amount of tries. Now, the app has various features such as changing the theme of the world and it even includes the 'alien wordle' theme (where the word changes if the user guesses the wrong word).

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total
